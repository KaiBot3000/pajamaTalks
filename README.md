## Pajama Talks
Lightning talks online!

#### Structure
Each speaker has 5 minutes to talk, 5 to do q/a
5-8 speakers = 1-1.5 hours

#### Topic Guidelines
Any topic goes! Try to choose something you can cover lightly in the time allowed. Don't worry about going in depth; lightning talks are meant to give an overview of the topic. Sharing a slide of resources at the end is a great way to help folks who were interested learn more!
